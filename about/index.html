During this period, American and British writers, including canonical figures such as Gertrude Stein, Christopher Isherwood, James Baldwin, and Paul Bowles, relocated from their native environments to continental Europe and North Africa, principally Capri, Paris, Berlin, and Tangier. This relocation was in part motivated by their sexuality, since both the US and the UK had established legal structures for the persecution of homosexuals during this period. In contrast, countries such as France and Italy had no legal framework for such persecution, and both Berlin and Tangier tolerated homosexuality within certain limits. By resettling, these writers helped to establish a widespread LGBTQ+ exile literary network. The visualizations on this site demonstrate the complex webs of attachment that existed between these writers. They capture both their movements and creative exchanges across borders. These visualizations draw on an initial data sample from the published memoirs and letter collections of a range of LGBTQ+ exile writers (see Sources). The project demonstrates that these diverse communities were intimately connected and dynamically linked by the movement of LGBTQ+ exile writers. </div><div class="text-left mx-auto max-w-3xl text-xl pt-8 pb-2 text-gray-700 font-bold">Project Leader Biography</div><div class="mx-auto text-gray-800 max-w-3xl"> Benjamin Robbins, PhD is a senior postdoctoral researcher in American literary and cultural studies within the Department for American Studies at the University of Innsbruck and project leader of “Networked Narratives: Queer Exile Literature 1900-1969,” which is funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).
